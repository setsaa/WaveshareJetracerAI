# Reinforcement Learning on Jetson Nano

Run your reinforcement learning (RL) model on a Jetson Nano.

## Preface

This project was a part of a postgraduate subject at the University of Technology Sydney called `43008 Reinforcement Learning`.

## Introduction

A Nvidia Jetson Nano is a small computer used for AI IoT devices. A common usecase for students is applying machine learning models to robotics such as remote controlled (RC) cars.

WaveShare is a company that makes the JetRacer AI, a DIY RC car designed to connect with a Jetson Nano computer.

> [!NOTE]
> The WaveShare JetRacer AI is not the same thing as the WaveShare JetRacer ROS AI, which uses a Raspberry Pi and which doesn't do AI processing on-device.
